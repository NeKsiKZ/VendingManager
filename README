🚀 VendingManager: IoT Vending Machine Management System

VendingManager is a comprehensive Full-Stack system simulating the management of a network of intelligent vending machines (IoT). The project demonstrates a modern, distributed architecture combining a server-side rendered administrative panel (MVC), a public client application (SPA), and real-time communication.

The application is fully containerized using Docker & Docker Compose and deployed on Microsoft Azure cloud.

🌐 Live Demo

The application is fully deployed and available online:

🔐 1. Admin Panel (Backend & MVC)

Fleet management, sales analytics, logistics.

Link: https://vendingmanager-app-bz123.purpleflower-915564b1.polandcentral.azurecontainerapps.io/

Credentials:

Email: admin@vending.com

Password: Admin123!

🛒 2. Client App (React Frontend)

Public interface for customers with an interactive map and virtual store.

📖 3. API Documentation (Swagger)

🏗️ Architecture & Tech Stack

The project was built with a focus on clean code, security, and scalability.

Backend (.NET 8)

Architecture: Hybrid (MVC for Admin Panel + REST API for devices/frontend).

Database: SQL Server (Azure SQL Database) using Entity Framework Core.

Real-Time: SignalR for live sales notifications and error reporting.

Security:

ASP.NET Core Identity (Roles: Admin, Operator).

API Key Authorization Filters (X-API-KEY) for M2M communication.

CORS policy for React client.

Storage: Azure Blob Storage for storing product images and Data Protection Keys.

Frontend (React + Vite)

UI: Responsive design based on Bootstrap 5.

Maps: Integration with Leaflet.js and React-Leaflet for fleet visualization.

State Management: Context API (shopping cart handling).

Communication: fetch API for consuming .NET backend.

DevOps & QA

Containerization: Full Docker and Docker Compose support (Multi-container setup).

Cloud: Deployed to Azure Container Apps (Backend) and Vercel (Frontend).

CI/CD: Automated GitHub Actions pipelines (Build & Test).

Testing:

xUnit: Unit tests for controllers and business logic.

Playwright: End-to-End (E2E) tests verifying frontend behavior.

✨ Key Features

1. Analytics Dashboard (Business Intelligence)

Real-time transaction data aggregation.

Dynamic sales charts (Chart.js) with date range filtering (Backend-side filtering).

Interactive map with markers changing color based on machine status (Online/Offline) and stock levels.

2. Shopping Simulator (Live)

User purchases a product in the React app.

Backend processes the transaction and updates the stock in SQL Server.

SignalR instantly pushes a "Toast" notification to the logged-in Administrator without refreshing the page.

3. Smart Logistics

The "Restocking" module automatically analyzes stock levels across all machines and generates:

A consolidated shopping list (what to pick from the warehouse).

A route list of machines requiring maintenance.

4. Error Management

The API accepts technical error reports from machines (e.g., "Coin Jam"), which are logged and presented to the administrator.

🚀 Local Setup (Docker)

The easiest way to run the entire system (App + DB) on your local machine. Requires Docker Desktop.

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/NeKsiKZ/VendingManager.git
cd VendingManager


Configure Environment Variables:
Create a .env file in the root solution directory and add a strong DB password:

SA_PASSWORD=YourStrongPassword123!


(Optional) Create .env.local in VendingManager.Client for API Key configuration.

Run Containers:

docker-compose up --build


Ready! The application will automatically run database migrations and seed the database with test data.

Store (React): http://localhost:8080 (or http://localhost:5173 via npm run dev)

Admin Panel: http://localhost:8080

Swagger API: http://localhost:8080/swagger

🧪 Testing

The project maintains high test coverage to ensure stability.

Backend Unit Tests

dotnet test


Tests: API logic, Dashboard statistics calculation, restocking list generation.

Frontend E2E Tests

Tests written in Playwright simulate user behavior in the browser.
(Requires running application).

// Example E2E Test Scenario (Playwright)
[Test]
public async Task Homepage_Should_Load_And_Show_Machines() {
    await Page.GotoAsync(AppUrl);
    // Wait for the second card to appear (ensuring data is fetched)
    await Expect(Page.Locator(".card").Nth(1)).ToBeVisibleAsync();
    // ...
}
